✅ I learned:

    🟢  how to work with CSV and Pandas Library ✔️
    🟢  what is a DataFrame and Series in Pandas (Rows and Colummns) ✔️
    🟢  that this code allow me to find the coordinates in the Turtle screen by clicking the mouse ✔️

        def get_mouse_click_coor(x, y):
            print(x, y)


        turtle.onscreenclick(get_mouse_click_coor)

        turtle.mainloop()

    🟢  this code: 
    
        state_name.write(state_data.state.item())  # In Pandas. It returns the first element of the underlying data as a Python scalar. 
        Link https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.item.html 👀 ✔️

    🟢  that this is a function built in Pandas to find the average or mean in list of numbers.
        Link: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.mean.html#pandas.Series.mean ✔️

        print(data["temp"].mean())
